                  <li>In most countries it is only the government, through their central banks, who are permitted to
                    issue
                    currency.
                    <br>
                    <b>Explanation</b> This is the first text box because it provides background information that makes
                    the
                    rest of the information in the passage stand out as significant.</li>
                  <li>But in Scotland three banks are still allowed to issue banknotes.<br>
                    <b>Explanation</b> This is the second text box because it introduces the subject of the passage.
                    However,
                    it is not the first sentence because “But” and “still allowed” signal that this sentence is
                    referring to
                    a restriction described in a previous sentence.</li>
                  <li>The first Scottish bank to do this was the Bank of Scotland.<br>
                    <b>Explanation</b> This is the third text box because it gives an example of one of the three banks
                    in
                    Scotland mentioned in the previous sentence. Also the phrase “to do this” refers to the phrase, “to
                    issue
                    banknotes” in the previous sentence.</li>
                  <li>When this bank was founded in 1695, Scots coinage was in short supply and of uncertain value,
                    compared
                    with English, Dutch, Flemish or French coin.<br>
                    <b>Explanation</b> This is the fourth text box because “this bank” refers to “the Back of Scotland”
                    mentioned
                    in the third sentence.</li>
                  <li>To face growth of trade it was deemed necessary to remedy this lack of an adequate currency.<br>
                    <b>Explanation</b> This is the fifth text box because it concludes the paragraph by giving a reason
                    why
                    the Bank of Scotland issued its own currency.</li>
                </ol>

                <ol>
                  <li>Markets may be good at encouraging innovation and following trends, but they were no good at
                    ensuring
                    social equality.
                    <br>
                    <b>Explanation</b> This is the first text box because it introduces the topic of the paragraph. All
                    of
                    the other text boxes contain clues that they refer to some previous sentence.
                  </li>
                  <li>These markets had become rapidly dominated by powerful enterprises who were able to act in their
                    own
                    interests, against the interests of both workers and consumers.<br>
                    <b>Explanation</b> This is the second text box because the sentence in it begins with “These
                    markets” which
                    is a sign that a sentence about markets came immediately before it.</li>
                  <li>There had already been some legislation to prevent such abuses - such as various Factory Acts to
                    prevent
                    the exploitation of child workers.<br>
                    <b>Explanation</b> This is the third text box because it discusses government response to the
                    situation
                    described in the previous text box. The phrase “such abuses” refers to the previous sentence’s
                    mention
                    of enterprises acting against the interests of workers.
                  </li>
                  <li>Mill was able to see an expanded role for the State in such legislation to protect us against
                    powerful
                    interests.
                    <br>
                    <b>Explanation</b> This is the fourth text box because it contains the phrase “such legislation”
                    which
                    refers to the “Factory Acts” in the preceding sentence.
                  </li>
                  <li>He was able to argue that the State was the only organ that was genuinely capable of responding
                    to social
                    needs and social interests, unlike markets.
                    <br>
                    <b>Explanation</b> This is the fifth text box because it concludes the paragraph by providing a
                    solution
                    to the problem raised in the first sentence. Additionally, “He” could only refer to “Mill”, which
                    is in
                    the previous text box, since “Mill” is the only proper name of a person used in the paragraph.</li>
