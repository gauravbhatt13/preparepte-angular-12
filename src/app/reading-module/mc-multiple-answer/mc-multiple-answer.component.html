          <p><b>Who Are Aborigines?</b>Aborigines are Australia's indigenous people. Recent government statistics
            counted approximately
            400,000 aboriginal people, or about 2% of Australia's total population. </p>
          <p>Australian Aborigines migrated from somewhere in Asia at least 30,000 years ago. Though they comprise
            500-600
            distinct groups, aboriginal people possess some unifying links. Among these are strong spiritual beliefs
            that tie
            them to the land; a tribal culture of storytelling and art; and, like other indigenous populations, a
            difficult
            colonial history.
          </p>
          <p><b>The Dreamtime: </b>Aboriginal spirituality entails a close relationship betweenhumans and the land
            Aborigines
            call the beginning of the world the "Dreaming" or "Dreamtime". In the "Dreamtime", aboriginal "Ancestors"
            rosefrom
            below the earth to form various parts of nature including animalspecies, bodies of water, and the sky.
            Unlike other
            religions, however,aboriginal belief does not place the human species apart from or on a higherlevel than
            nature.
            Aborigines believe some of the Ancestors metamorphosedinto nature (as in rock formations or rivers), where
            they
            remain spiritually alive.
          </p>
          <p><b>Storytelling. Art. and the Didgeridoo:</b> The oral tradition of storytellinginforms aboriginals'
            vibrant cultural
            life. Songs illustrate the Dreamtime andother tales of the land, while dances and diagrams drawn in the
            sandaccompany
            oral tales. In the Northern Territory, aboriginal art includessculpture, bark and rock paintings, and
            baskets and
            beadwork. Rockcarvings and paintings can be found in such places as Arnhem Land, Ubirr,and Nourlangie. Many
            aborigines
            earn a living through selling native artworks. </p>
          <p>Aboriginal music is often recognizable for its most famous instrument, thedidgeridoo. A wind instrument
            typically
            made from bamboo, it extends aboutfive feet and produces a low, vibrating hum. Aborigines use didgeridoos
            informal
            ceremonies at such events as sunsets, circumcisions, and funerals.

      <p>
        Adaptations enable living organisms to cope with environmental stresses and pressures. Adaptation can be
        structural or behavioral.
        Structural adaptations are special body parts of an organism that help it to survive in its natural habitat (e
        g.,
        skin color, shape, body covering). Behavioral adaptations are the ways a particular organism behaves to survive
        in
        its natural habitat. Physiological adaptations are systems present in an organism that allow it to perform
        certain
        biochemical reactions (e g. making venom, secreting slime, being able to keep a constant body temperature).
        Adaptations
        are traits that have been selected for by natural selection. The underlying genetic basis for the adaptive
        trait did
        not arise as a consequence of the environment; the genetic variant pre-existed and was subsequently selected
        because
        it provided the bearer of that variant some advantage.
