              <h4>Transcript</h4>
              <p>So far in our discussion of chemical equations we have assumed that these reactions only go in one
                direction, the forward direction, from left to right as we read it in an equation. That's why our
                arrowhead points from left to right: reactants react together to make products. However, this is not
                exactly how things occur in reality. In fact, practically every chemical reaction is reversible,
                meaning
                the products can also react together to reform the reactants that they were made of. So instead of
                writing that single arrow facing from right to top, a more appropriate symbol would be a double arrow,
                one going from left to right and one going from right to left. Reactants are continually - continuously
                -
                reacting to form produce. But at the same time as those products are formed, they remake the reactants.
                They're both going simultaneously, forming each other. This is what we would call a state of equality.</p>

              <p>I think the importance of creativity today really reflects a fundamental rift in the nature of the
                economy. You know, in the old days, wealth was created because in the industrial era, you manufactured
                everything, you got economies of scale, you had long production runs, you were really
                - you know, you could get a Model T, any color just so long as it was black. Right? So there was . And
                there was a whole set of presumptions about how to manage, how to create an organization - you know, a
                typical kind of hierarchical organization - to make sure that things ran smoothly. Well, that may be
                great
                for a relatively stable era of history - relatively stable - but now things are functionally unstable -
                and
                so we need less economies of scale and more economies of recovery. Which means that the management
                approach, the organizational approach, has got to shift as well.</p>
